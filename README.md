# Mastering Admin Rights: Transfer Admin and Clear Admin
![WebappUI](./public/admin.png)

This project demonstrates how to implement and manage **admin rights**, specifically focusing on **Transfer Admin** and **Clear Admin** functionalities within fungible tokens. It uses **Go** for the backend, handling blockchain transactions and smart contract interactions, **Axios** for fetching APIs, and **Next.js** for the frontend, providing a user interface to interact with the tokens.

Participants will learn about the basics of managing **admin rights** in fungible tokens, including how to transfer admin privileges and clear admin permissions on the blockchain. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a functional understanding of how to manage these administrative controls using Go for the backend, Axios for backend API interactions, and React.js for the frontend.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture of fungible tokens and the role of admin rights.
- Set up a development environment with **Go** and **React**.
- Build an HTTP server and middleware in **Go**.
- Implement **Transfer Admin** functionality to delegate admin rights on fungible tokens.
- Implement **Clear Admin** functionality to remove admin privileges from a token.
- Interact with the **Coreum blockchain** to manage admin rights on tokens.

## Prerequisites

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of the blockchain ecosystem.
- Experience with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
- Familiarity with **Node.js** and npm package management.
- Basic knowledge of the **Go** programming language.
- A code editor of your choice installed (e.g., **VS Code**).
